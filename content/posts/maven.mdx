- Maven uses **POM (project object model)**

### Maven project structure

- ⭐ **groupId** and **artifactId** uniquely identify a project in maven central

### Project lifecycle
- all steps are sequential (if you need to run phase 4 goal 3, all steps from phase 1 to phase 4 goal 2 need to run first)
- phase (`> tasks/goals`)
- you can add more goals / plugins to each phase

1. **validate** project structure - `mvn validate` - by default, if you don't add any plugins (eg: checkstyle), maven does not validate anything
2. **compile** source code - `mvn compile` - compile and put the code under `${project.basedir}/target/classes` - internally does stuff using `javac`
3. **test** the code (unit test) - `mvn test`
4. **package** compiled code (produce jar/war) - `jar` will be placed in `target/` and this can be shipped to prod or added as a dependency in some other project, etc.
5. **verify** the code (static code analysis) - maven does not verify anything by default unless you add plugins like `maven-pmd-plugin`
6. **install** the package in local repository
   - a local repo is present in your system
   - remote repos - nexus salesforce repo, maven central public repo
7. **deploy** the package to remote repo

### How to configure which maven repo is used
- default `~/.m2/repository`
- can change through `~/.m2/settings.xml`

### TODO next
- learn more about how jars can be imported and their packages can be used in other codebases
- how a jar can be deployed on local using tomcat
