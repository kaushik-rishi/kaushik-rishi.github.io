I have recently come across a [linked post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/demitriswan_softwareengineering-activity-7124104077537382401-jW3d) of a google software engineer, Although the post was centered around software engineering, I related it with my health journey.

It has been a while since I am working out regularly (consitently 3-4 times every week), Roughly 2 years, My diet and my consistency on a microscopic level has not been fine, there've been months where I binged on sugars, cookies, ice creams, due to loneliness and lack of resources, but even in my darkest times, I used to keep myself physically active.

This is a quote that i can base upon, look back at my journey and tell myself at night, that i came a long way.
```
Your path is yours, And yours alone.
```

## How I spent my early teens

All I remember when i was 17-19 (even 20), was being frail, weak and a victim of ton of health issues. I used to weigh **42kg** at a height of **5 feet 8 inch**, which was extremely underweight, I would still not consider myself unhealthy just based on this fact, but it was the health issues that ate my life away.

I was 17.5/18 years old, preparing for JEE in my 11th standard, when i started experiencing a pain in the end of my backbone and couldn't sit without feeling the pain, When i got it checked it was **Coccydynia**, tldr; you feel a sharp pain in your back whenever you are sitting, doesn't matter where, its constant, and there was no specific cure to it. My pelvic floor was literally fu*ked.

I started having cranky knees when i was 18, Stiff knees with sharp pain whenever i folded my knee. I had a sinus issue going on all my life, so that's there during winters.

Neither was my mental health pretty great at that point in my life, I lagged everywhere in my JEE prep, There used to be nights that i spent sitting alone, sad, worrying why I was having these issues while all my friends are fit and healthy.

## How my early 20's changed me
I'm currently 22 and It's been 5 years since i first got coccydynia, and surprise ...., no surprises here, I still have it, It feels like it's not going to go away anytime soon. It has become my best friend, My best company that never left me and **had my back** for 5 years.

My knee pains have reduced drastically too.

One main reason for all of this is that I started working out
