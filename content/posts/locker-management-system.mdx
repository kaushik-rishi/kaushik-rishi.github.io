# Locker Management System

## Notes

### Model Classes

- Models are the most important thing to sort out first, once you are clear with the models 50% of your problem is solved then and there
- Have `id` field for every model, eg: `id` for `Locker` and `slotId` for `Slot`
- Generally have back references in Models for ease during writing code / implementing business logic
```java
// models/locker.java
public class Locker {
    private String id;
    private List<Slot> slots;
}

// models/slot.java
public class Slot {
    private String slotId;
    private Locker locker;
}
```

#### Doubts
- do these models not need to be exact maps of db tables ?
- do i need more insight into spring part to get idea of this ?
- can methods be bound to models ?
  - `Slot` - `allocatePackage` & `deallocateSlot` & `isAvailable`
  - `Locker` - `getAvailableSlots`
- NEED CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF `MODELS` relation with `DB`

### About Thread Safety ‚≠ê
- in this implementation you will see a couple of methods marked as `synchronized` for the sake of thread safety
- BUT IN GENERAL INTERVIEWS, YOU SPECIFICALLY ASK THE INTERVIEWER `I DON'T THINK THIS METHOD IS THREAD SAFE ? DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE IT THREAD SAFE ?`
- 2 kinds / level of interviews
  - level 1
    - entitites, relation building
    - model designing
    - uml
    - business logic
  - level 2 
    - thread safety
    - performance
    - os concepts like mutex locks
    - perf testing tooling


## Structure of LLD problems involving entity and business logic (not games)
1. Controller
    - API
    - where the call will start
    - all API kinda methods land here
2. Repository
    - storage part
    - db or in memory data store etc
3. Service
   - business logic 
4. Strategies (auxilliary)
   - for extensibility
5. Exceptions (aux.)
6. Utils (aux.)
