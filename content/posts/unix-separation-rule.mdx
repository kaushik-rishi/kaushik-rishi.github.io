## Sliding Doors example

- when a new employee joins
  - DO NOT:
    - change the sliding doors for his access card to work
  - DO:
    - alter db of access control to add a new entry for Jon

- Opening / Closing operation = Mechanism
- Access control database = Policy
  - Place that stores policy which determines who is allowed/disallowed access.

## Example of Amalgamated Mechanism and Policy
- Front door
- When you rent the house
  - you change the whole lock
  - Why ?
    - the key is physically built into the lock
    - physical coupling - policy changes, mechanism should change as well
