### Some Requirements ?
- write operations: satisfy a set of requirements before data persistence
- set of requirements to be met before running something
- validate some data against a set of validation rules

### Issues
1. chain of if statements
2. ad-hoc priority management
    - we need to fiddle around if statements
    - worse when the if-else blockes are interlinked or share some state
3. lack of state management
    -  Hard to
       -  share state
       -  export the side effect after validations have run
4. lack of variety of logical operations
    - no declarative or incremental way to specify how we want validation units to run
      - run till we hit first fails ?
      - run all validation units irrespective of they fail or not ?
      - run all the units in async manner ?
