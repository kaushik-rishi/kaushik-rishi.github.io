## Purpose
- sending immutable data between objects
- such classes
  - hold data
  - database results
  - query results
  - information from a service

Nature of that data
- immutable
- **why ?** : immutability ensures the validity of data without synchronization.

## Data class characteristics
1. `private`, `final` field for each piece of data
2. `getter` for each field
3. `public constructor` with a corresponding argument for each field
4. `equals` method that returns true for objects of the same class when all fields match
5. `hashCode` method that returns the same value when all fields match
6. `toString` method that includes the name of the class and the name of each field and its corresponding value

- Problems with writing data classes on our own
    1. ton of boilerplate
    2. we obscure the purpose of our class: to represent a person with a name and address
    3. have to update equals and hashCode with every new property added


This is what record classes will mimic, with some more features for
1. static properties
2. constructor customization

## `Object` class and default method

- Every class inherits `Object`, which by default has 3 methods 
  - `toString`
  - `equals`
  - `hashCode`
- `hashCode` method
  - easier way to compare 2 data classes
  - kind of a unique identifier for our object
