# OS: Threads vs Processes + CPU core/thread stuff

## Thread vs Proccess

![process vs thread](/posts/concurrency/processvsthread.png)

### Proccess
- instance of a program in execution
- has own resources - memory, thread - os allocates when process is created
- when jvm runs the bytecode, that's when process is spawned
- **Qsn:** how can a process get it's own memory and resources if the jvm itself will have a limited memory allocated to it ?

### Thread
- lightweight process (or) smallest sequence of instructions that are executed by CPU independently
- 1 process can have multiple threads

- Java: when a process is created:
  - it starts with 1 thread and that initial thread known as `main thread` and from that we can create multiple threads to perform concurrent tasks

```java
public class MLTExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // output: Thread Name: main
    sout("Thread name : " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
  }
}
```

### How much memory does process gets ?
- while creating process "java MainClassName"
- a new JVM instance will get created and we decide how much heap need to be allocated

- here you can see that new jvm instance is created for each process
  - each process has 3 threads
    - shared components between threads
      - code segment
        - container compiled bytecode of java program
        - **read only**
      - data segment
        - global and static variables
        - **threads can modify the same data**
        - because of above point, synchronization is needed b/w multiple threads
      - heap memory
        - `new` keyword objects
        - threads in a process share heap memory
        - **threads can modify the same data**
        - because of above point, synchronization is needed b/w multiple threads
    - separate components between threads
      - stack: each stack has one
      - register
        - Bytecode -> Machinecode through JIT, that's when we need intermediate variables
        - helps in context switching ⭐⭐⭐
      - counter
        - points to instruction which is getting executed

![new instance of jvm for each process](/posts/concurrency/jvm-instances-threads.png) 

- But if parent JVM has 10gb memory, do the childs use it all ? No, we control the memory using the below command (controlled automatically too)
  - But whatever all the processes require jvm memory, it will all be under the 10gb only
```
java -Xms256m -Xmx2g MainClassName

-Xms<size> : sets initial heap size, i've set 256mb, max it can allocate is 2gb
```

### Example whole flow
- javac Main.java
- Bytecode generated
- javac Main
- 1 Process will be created
- new JVM instance is allocated (-Xms1g)
- Interpreter or JIT compiler starts converting bytecode to machinecode
   - realises there's 3 threads in code
   - initialises 3 threads with their own register, stack and counter
   - Machine code -> will go into -> **Code Segment**
- **Code segment** will have all the machine code
- Each **counter** of each thread points to some position in **Code segment**
- Now how will we run the program ?
  - Assume it's a **single core single cpu system**
    - 1cpu
    - 1 register
    - 1 cache
    - 1 RAM

```

⭐ watch from this timestamp - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpYIcJN9EV8&t=2067s) - Context switching.

### Important note - will be clear after watching the linked video
- if theres 10 threads and 1 cpu, all the threads need to do context switching
- if we have 2 cpus, some 2 threads might be running actually parallelly
- context switching gives a visualisation of parallell programming


### Defn of Multithreading
- allows a program to perform multiple operations at the same time
- ⭐ Multiple threads share the same resource such as memory space but still can perform task independently

### Pros/Cons of MLT
Benefits
- improved perf. thro. parallelisn
- resource sharing
- responsiveness
- All of these threads execute in parallel. The use time slices or, if the machine has more than one processor, then truly in parallel.
- One of the advantages of using a thread group instead of a process group is that many operations can be performed in parallel. This allows events to be handled as they arrive.
- Read this: https://www.baeldung.com/cs/process-vs-thread#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-threads-rather-than-processes

Challenges
- Concurrency issues like deadlock, data inconsistency - need to handle through synchronization
- synchronized overhead
- testing and debugging is difficult

### Multitasking vs Multithreading
- Process1 and process2 - multi tasking - no resource sharing (diff. tasks)
- threads inside a process - multi threading - resource sharing (same task)
