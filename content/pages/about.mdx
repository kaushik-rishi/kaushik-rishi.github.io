Hey, I'm Rishi, a SWE, and a wanna be digital nomad. 👨‍💻

## Why did i even start this page ?

- For public presence ? Nope. 
- To earn from content creation ? Nope.
- Because I love writing ? Hmmmm. A big no.
- I started this page to keep my journey tracked and reflect on crucial parts/changes that take place in my life. 🛟

## What kind of stuff can you find here?
*Growing in Public*

Writings can vary from health, to fitness to any personal journey / failure / success or a small engineering blog too.
